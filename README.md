# Research on Weather Patterns 
The pandemic, coupled with climate change and the Ukraine-Russian war, possess as an ever-increasing threat to many developed and underdeveloped countries worldwide. To cushion the effects and help with the crisis,  I have focused my research on the agricultural sector, where most products such as wheat and grain are grown.  I have decided to work on predicting the severity of droughts. This is to better prepare farmers for droughts by allowing them to make more informed decisions based on the data and prediction through weather and soil data collected. Our approach consists of first understanding the data through Exploratory Data Analysis, after which we would pre-process and transform the data to aid in model developments. Finally, we would conclude with the results and analysis. The code is available in the Zip file.
